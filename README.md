# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data

Here, I used Python and its libraries, to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. 
After wrangling the data, I documented my wrangling efforts and showcased them through analyses and visualizations using Python. 
The dataset I wrangled was the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs.
